# Multisite Active Directory Collaborated Lab with IPsec VPN and Security Monitoring
Welcome to the multisite active directory lab with site-to-site VPN configuration and implemented security measures. This lab has been created in collaboration with [edris526](https://github.com/edris526).

![PROJECT-MAP](images/project-diagram.png)

This project simulates a realistic enterprise network environment across three geographically separated Active Directory (AD) sites, interconnected through IPSec VPN tunnels. It provides a platform for blue team monitoring and red team simulation, suitable for learning, research, and testing in cybersecurity and system administration.

# Project Overview

## üåê Domain: `project.lab`

### üè¢ Sites Overview

- **KBL SITE** (`192.168.1.0/24`)  
  - Server: `KBL-SRV`  
  - Roles: Splunk Universal Forwarder, Sysmon  
  - VPN Connection: IPSec Tunnel to MZR and HRT


- **HRT SITE** (`192.168.2.0/24`)  
  - Domain Controller: `HRT-SRV (ADC)`
      - Roles: Splunk Universal Forwarder, Sysmon 
  - Ubentu Server: Splunk Indexer  
  - Endpoints:
    - `Windows 10 Client`: Atomic Red Team
    - `Kali Linux`: Simulated attacker system  
  - VPN Connection: IPSec Tunnel to MZR and KBL

- **MZR SITE** (`192.168.3.0/24`)  
  - Server: `MZR-SRV`  
  - Roles: Splunk Universal Forwarder, Sysmon  
  - VPN Connection: IPSec Tunnel to KBL and HRT

## üîê Security & Monitoring Stack

- **IPSec Site-to-Site VPN**  
  Ensures secure and encrypted communication between the AD sites using virtual tunnel interfaces (VTIs).

- **Splunk Monitoring**
  - **Indexer** hosted at HRT
  - **Universal Forwarders** installed on all servers
  - **Sysmon** for endpoint visibility and Windows telemetry

- **Atomic Red Team (ART)**
  - Deployed at **HRT site** to simulate adversary behavior for security testing and detection engineering.

- **Red Team Simulation**
  - `Kali Linux` machine performs **brute-force attacks** on the Windows 10 system's **RDP service** using the **Hydra tool**.
  - Attack telemetry is collected and analyzed via Splunk.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a secure, isolated, and production-like multi-site AD infrastructure.
- Implement encrypted routing between sites using IPSec VPN.
- Gain hands-on experience with log aggregation and detection engineering using Splunk.
- Test endpoint detection and response (EDR) strategies with Sysmon and ART.
- Simulate real-world attacks and analyze their artifacts in a monitored environment.

## üìÅ Tools & Technologies

- **VMware:** used for virtualization of network components (VyOS routers and end-hosts)
- **Windows Server 2019/2022**, **Windows 10**
- **Kali Linux**
- **Splunk Enterprise**, **Splunk Universal Forwarder**
- **Sysmon**
- **Atomic Red Team**
- **Hydra**
- **VyOS**

---

## üß† Ideal For:

- Students and professionals learning enterprise AD topology
- Blue teamers practicing log analysis and detection
- Red teamers testing adversary simulation in isolated labs
- SOC analysts refining Splunk dashboards and alerts
