# Multisite Active Directory Collaborated Lab with IPsec VPN and Security Monitoring
Welcome to the multisite active directory lab with site-to-site VPN configuration and implemented security measures. This lab has been created in collaboration with [edris526](https://github.com/edris526).

![PROJECT-MAP](images/project-diagram.png)

This project simulates a realistic enterprise network environment across three geographically separated Active Directory (AD) sites, interconnected through IPSec VPN tunnels. It provides a platform for blue team monitoring and red team simulation, suitable for learning, research, and testing in cybersecurity and system administration.

# Network Configuration

We are going to use VMware for the servers and routers virtualization. In this project, all routers and servers have been previously installed so you need to be able to install virtual machines such as Windows Server 2022 and VyOS routers by yourself. 

Each VyOS router needs at least two interfaces, one for the internal network (with a host-only VMnet) and another for WAN purposes (Using a VMnet with Bridge mode). In VMware go to `Edit` then click on `Vitual Network Editor`. You need to configure two VMnets (in this case, VMnet0 for Bridge adapter and VMnet1 for host-only). Then you have to go to your router's settings and add another Network adapter. Set each adapter to the correct VMnet. Do this for all routers. (the images below show VyOS-KBL's VMnet setup)
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/004a.vmnets.png" width="350">
  <img src="images/004b.kblvmnet.png" width="350">
</p>

Now you can configure your router's interfaces. In order to apply changes to VyOS interfaces you need to go to 'configure' mode by using `configure` command. Then use this command `set interfaces ethernet eth0 address x.x.x.x/x` to manually set IP Address of a router's interface. Use `set interfaces ethernet eth1 address dhcp` for the bridged interfaces of the router to get an IP from the Bridge Network of your computer. You can optionally use `set interfaces ethernet eth0 description To-KBL` to set a description for your interface. Don't forget to commit and save your changes by `commit` and `save` commands. You can run `show interfaces` command to list the interfaces. Image below shows the interface config for the VyOS-KBL:

![kbl-interfaces](images/004-kblvyosinterfaces.png)

Configure network of the servers existing in each site.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/001%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20kabul.png" width="250">
  <img src="images/002%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20herat.png" width="250">
  <img src="images/003%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20mazar.png" width="250">
</p>

In order to have reachability to each site, we need to configure a routing protocol. In this case we are using OSPF. Configure OSPF on each site's VyOS router following the commands in the image below. 

![ospf-config](images/005-ospf-config.png)

`set protocols ospf redistribute connected` tells VyOS to advertise all directly connected networks (that are not already included via network statements) into OSPF. You can check OSPF neighborship with this command `show ip ospf neighbors`, use `run` with to excute non-configuration commands in configuration mode. Image below shows neighbors associated with KBL router (you can see that it has only one neighbor which is VyOS-MZR. HRT's router hasn't been configured with OSPF yet)

![ospf-show](images/005-ospf-nei.png)

You can set the DNS server of the router using `set system nameserver x.x.x.x` command. You can optionally set a defualt route using your Bridge Network's gateway as the next-hop for the default route.

![def-route](images/006b-default0-route.png)

Another important configuration is Network Address Translation (NAT) for the end-hosts in each site to have internet access. Follow below commands to configure NAT in each router:

![nat](images/006a-nat.png)

We basically used PAT in this case which is achieved using `set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade`.

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup
2. Splunk Enterprise Setup:
   First downlaod splunk enterprise and ubentu server. I will host splunk enterprise on uebntu server. 
 1) Introduction to Splunk Enterprise:
 Splunk Enterprise is a widely adopted platform designed for collecting, indexing, and analyzing machine data in real time. It supports log ingestion from a wide range of sources and is commonly used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. With its powerful search capabilities and rich visualizations, Splunk helps security teams detect threats, investigate incidents, and monitor system activity effectively.
2)my benefits from working on splunk on this lab.
Integrating Splunk Enterprise into my home lab environment has been a valuable step toward building practical cybersecurity skills. With this setup, I can continuously monitor system activity, detect suspicious behavior, and simulate real-world SOC operations. This hands-on approach not only strengthens my understanding of how modern security tools work but also improves my ability to respond to potential threats‚Äîan essential skillset for anyone pursuing a career in cybersecurity.
3) Downloading Splunk Enterprise (Free Trial):
Visit the Official [Splunk Website](https://www.splunk.com) log in or sign up. after logging in hover to Platrom and select free trials and Downalods. Select Splunk Enterprise Get My Free Trieal. Select your host operating system. Since meine is Ubentu server I  chose linux with .deb pacakge.

4) Downloading Ubuntu server:
 I downloaded the latest LTS version of Ubuntu from the [Ubuntu Downloads page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). At the time of writing, the newest version available was Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, and the ISO file was approximately 3GB

5) Creating the Ubuntu VM:
With the ISO downloaded, I proceeded to create the Ubuntu VM on vmware workstation:
![ubentuServerVMOverview.png](images/sec/ubentuServerVMOverview.png)
  Network Configuration:
![Image of VMnet2 config](images/sec/VMnet2.png)

6) Installing Uebntu Server:
   I inserted uebntu-server's iso image to the newly created vm and booted up. I used default installation meaning just hit enter till the system starts rebooting.
   After installing Ubuntu Server on your VMware VM, you can manage it remotely from your Windows machine using PuTTY, a popular SSH client. This makes it easier to copy commands, transfer files, and manage your SOC lab from a single interface. Ubuntu Server VM should be  powered on and connected to the same network with the host machine. 

OpenSSH Server is installed and running on Ubuntu
(This is usually enabled during Ubuntu Server installation. If not, install it with: sudo apt install openssh-server). Find the IP Address of Your Ubuntu Server
On your Ubuntu VM, run:
ip a
Look for the IP address under your active network interface (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
![ipaddress config of ubentu server](images/sec/ipA.png)
Open PuTTY on Windows
Enter the IP Address
In the Host Name (or IP address) field, type the IP of your Ubuntu Server
Make sure the Port is set to 22 (default for SSH)
Connection type: SSH
![putty](images/sec/putty.png)
Click ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù
Log In

A terminal window will open
Enter your Ubuntu username and password
![Login Putty](images/sec/loginPutty.png)
![Putty Overview](images/sec/puttyOverview.png)
   

and I took a snapshot of the VM, which is in its clean, fully updated state. This will allow me to revert to this baseline if needed.

7) uentu server network config:
   since I am in HRT-Site. I am allocating the ip address 192.168.2.10 to the ubentu server. my default gateway will be the vyos router and my dns will be dns of my host machine. in general the dns server should be 8.8.8.8; however my country traffic is filtert via DNS and configureing a machines DNS to 8.8.8.8 will lose internet conenctivey. The slution is to use my home router as the DNS server , the same way all of my devices at home are configured.
   to set ip address , default gateway and dns server on ubentu server I used the follwoing command: sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
   ![network config ubentu server](images/sec/netplan.png)
   Now I have internet connectivity. 
 ![ping](images/sec/ping.png)
afterwards I updated my system using sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade.
