# Multisite Active Directory Collaborated Lab with IPsec VPN and Security Monitoring
Welcome to the multisite active directory lab with site-to-site VPN configuration and implemented security measures. This lab has been created in collaboration with [edris526](https://github.com/edris526).

![PROJECT-MAP](images/project-diagram.png)

This project simulates a realistic enterprise network environment across three geographically separated Active Directory (AD) sites, interconnected through IPSec VPN tunnels. It provides a platform for blue team monitoring and red team simulation, suitable for learning, research, and testing in cybersecurity and system administration.

# Network Configuration

We are going to use VMware for the servers and routers virtualization. In this project, all routers and servers have been previously installed so you need to be able to install virtual machines such as Windows Server 2022 and VyOS routers by yourself. 

Each VyOS router needs at least two interfaces, one for the internal network (with a host-only VMnet) and another for WAN purposes (Using a VMnet with Bridge mode). In VMware go to `Edit` then click on `Vitual Network Editor`. You need to configure two VMnets (in this case, VMnet0 for Bridge adapter and VMnet1 for host-only). Then you have to go to your router's settings and add another Network adapter. Set each adapter to the correct VMnet. Do this for all routers. (the images below show VyOS-KBL's VMnet setup)
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/004a.vmnets.png" width="350">
  <img src="images/004b.kblvmnet.png" width="350">
</p>

Now you can configure your router's interfaces. In order to apply changes to VyOS interfaces you need to go to 'configure' mode by using `configure` command. Then use this command `set interfaces ethernet eth0 address x.x.x.x/x` to manually set IP Address of a router's interface. Use `set interfaces ethernet eth1 address dhcp` for the bridged interfaces of the router to get an IP from the Bridge Network of your computer. You can optionally use `set interfaces ethernet eth0 description To-KBL` to set a description for your interface. Don't forget to commit and save your changes by `commit` and `save` commands. You can run `show interfaces` command to list the interfaces. Image below shows the interface config for the VyOS-KBL:

![kbl-interfaces](images/004-kblvyosinterfaces.png)

Configure network of the servers existing in each site.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/001%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20kabul.png" width="250">
  <img src="images/002%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20herat.png" width="250">
  <img src="images/003%20-%20ip%20set%20site%20mazar.png" width="250">
</p>

In order to have reachability to each site, we need to configure a routing protocol. In this case we are using OSPF. Configure OSPF on each site's VyOS router following the commands in the image below. 

![ospf-config](images/005-ospf-config.png)

`set protocols ospf redistribute connected` tells VyOS to advertise all directly connected networks (that are not already included via network statements) into OSPF. You can check OSPF neighborship with this command `show ip ospf neighbors`, use `run` with to excute non-configuration commands in configuration mode. Image below shows neighbors associated with KBL router (you can see that it has only one neighbor which is VyOS-MZR. HRT's router hasn't been configured with OSPF yet)

![ospf-show](images/005-ospf-nei.png)

You can set the DNS server of the router using `set system nameserver x.x.x.x` command. You can optionally set a defualt route using your Bridge Network's gateway as the next-hop for the default route.

![def-route](images/006b-default0-route.png)

Another important configuration is Network Address Translation (NAT) for the end-hosts in each site to have internet access. Follow below commands to configure NAT in each router:

![nat](images/006a-nat.png)

We basically used PAT in this case which is achieved using `set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade`.
You can verify NAT translations with `show nat source translations` command. After NAT is configured, make sure end hosts have internet access by pinging google.com.

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup
2. Splunk Enterprise Setup:
   I started by downloading both Splunk Enterprise and Ubuntu Server. Splunk will be hosted on the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.
 üìå Introduction to Splunk Enterprise:
 Splunk Enterprise is a widely adopted platform designed for collecting, indexing, and analyzing machine data in real time. It supports log ingestion from a wide range of sources and is commonly used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. With its powerful search capabilities and rich visualizations, Splunk helps security teams detect threats, investigate incidents, and monitor system activity effectively.
2)my benefits from working on splunk on this lab.
Integrating Splunk Enterprise into my home lab environment has been a valuable step toward building practical cybersecurity skills. With this setup, I can continuously monitor system activity, detect suspicious behavior, and simulate real-world SOC operations. This hands-on approach not only strengthens my understanding of how modern security tools work but also improves my ability to respond to potential threats‚Äîan essential skillset for anyone pursuing a career in cybersecurity.
‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading Splunk Enterprise (Free Trial)
1.Visit the official [Splunk website](https://www.splunk.com)
2.Log in or create a free account.
3.Navigate to Products > Free Trials and Downloads.
4.Select Splunk Enterprise, then click Get My Free Trial.
5.Choose your host operating system. Since I‚Äôm using Ubuntu Server, I selected the Linux .deb package for Debian-based distributions.

2.Downloading Ubuntu server:
 I downloaded the latest LTS version of Ubuntu from the [Ubuntu Downloads page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). At the time of writing, the newest version available was Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, and the ISO file was approximately 3GB

   3.Creating the Ubuntu VM on VMware:
With the ISO downloaded, I proceeded to create the Ubuntu VM on vmware workstation:
-Allocated 2 CPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 30 GB disk space.
-Used VMnet2(hostonly) to ensure connectivity with my vyos router.
![ubentuServerVMOverview.png](images/sec/ubentuServerVMOverview.png)
  Network Configuration:
![Image of VMnet2 config](images/sec/VMnet2.png)

4. Installing Uebntu Server:
I attached the ISO to the new VM and started the system. I used the default installation options, pressing Enter until installation completed and the system rebooted.
5. Enabling Remote Access with PuTTY
After installation, I used PuTTY on my Windows host to connect to the Ubuntu Server VM.
üîå Prerequisites
The VM must be powered on and connected to the same network as the host.
Ensure OpenSSH Server is installed (enabled by default). If not, install it:
<pre lang="markdown">bash sudo apt install openssh-server</pre>
üîç Finding the IP Address
Run this command on the Ubuntu VM:
<pre lang="markdown">bash
  ip a</pre>
üì∏ Example:
![ipaddress config of ubentu server](images/sec/ipA.png)
üíª Access via PuTTY
Open PuTTY on Windows.
Enter the IP address in the Host Name field.
Set Port to 22 and Connection Type to SSH.
Click Open.
üì∏ PuTTY Configuration:
![putty](images/sec/putty.png)
Log In
A terminal window will open
Enter your Ubuntu username and password
![Login Putty](images/sec/loginPutty.png)
![Putty Overview](images/sec/puttyOverview.png)
   

I then took a snapshot of the VM at this clean, fully updated state to serve as a baseline for future rollback if needed.

7) uentu server network config:
   Since I'm working in the HRT-Site environment, I assigned the following static IP settings:
-IP Address: 192.168.2.10
-Gateway: My VyOS router
-DNS Server: My home router's IP (instead of 8.8.8.8, since external DNS is filtered in my country)
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Setting DNS to 8.8.8.8 caused internet loss due to regional filtering. Using my home router as DNS resolved the issue.
üõ†Ô∏è To Set Static IP
Edit the Netplan configuration file:
<pre lang="markdown">bash
  sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</pre>
üì∏ Netplan Configuration:
   ![network config ubentu server](images/sec/netplan.png)
   Apply changes and verify internet connectivity:
   <pre lang="markdown"> bash 
   sudo netplan apply
   ping google.com </pre>
   üì∏ Ping Test:
 ![ping](images/sec/ping.png)
7. System Update
Finally, I updated the Ubuntu system to ensure all packages were current:
<pre lang="markdown">bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade</pre>
